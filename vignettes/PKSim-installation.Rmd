# Not required for `{ospsuite}` version equal or above 12.1.0

Since `{ospsuite}` was released in version 12.1.0, all the necessary OSPSuite 
and PK-Sim dependencies are included in the package. Therefore, there is no need
to install extra software to use `{ospsuite}`.

Also, `{ospsuite}` is fully self contained and is independant from any  version 
of OSPSuite and PK-Sim installed on the user computer.


However, a script is provided in the package for developpers in order to get/update the latest dependencies (or core files): [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/blob/main/update_core_files.R)




# Versions below 12.1.0

Some features available in `{ospsuite}` require the installation of
[PK-Sim](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim). 

It is necessary to have a PK-Sim installation that matches the version of 
`{ospsuite}` (*i.e* to use `{ospsuite}` v11.y.z, you need to have PK-Sim v11 installed).

It is possible to install PK-Sim globally for the whole system, but also 
locally on a per-project basis. The following sections describe both options.

## Install PK-Sim Globally

1.  Download PK-Sim

Download the `pk-sim-portable-setup.zip` with matching version of `{ospsuite}` you are using [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim/releases).

2.  Enable using .dll from zip

Windows Defender prevents applications downloaded from untrusted sources from
being loaded. Before extracting the downloaded portable version, you have to
unblock it.

-   Right click on the downloaded archive and select "Properties" (on
    Windows 11, you have to select "Show more options" first),
-  In the Properties-window, select the checkbox "Unblock".

3.  Close all R sessions

Make sure that no R session have `{ospsuite}` is loaded or close all R session.


4. Extract PK-Sim

Extract the downloaded portable PK-Sim to this location `C:/Open Systems
Pharmacology/` (if this folder does not exist, create it).
Change the version number in the folder name to match the PK-Sim version you
downloaded while keeping only the two digits. For example, if you downloaded
PK-Sim 11.3.208, the folder name should be `PK-Sim 11.0`.


# Install and use PK-Sim in a project

Follow the steps from the previous section to download and extract PK-Sim to 
 a `PKSim` folder in your project folder.


Then, include the following code lines at the beginning of the projects scripts:

```r
ospsuite::initPKSim(pksimFolderPath = "PKSim")
```

⚠️ **Important**: If you run this command without any path or the wrong path before,
you must restart your R session before running it again with the correct path.
