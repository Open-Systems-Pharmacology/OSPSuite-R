# Installation

The **ospsuite** package requires R version 4.x.x and supports
[Windows](#on-windows) and [Linux (Ubuntu)](#on-linux) operating
systems.

`ospsuite` is not available on CRAN and depends on packages from the OSP
ecosystem that are not available on CRAN. Follow the instructions below
to install the package and all required dependencies.

## Pre-requisites

The `{ospsuite}` package requires `{rSharp}` and its external
dependencies (Visual C++ Redistributable and .NET 8). Install these
dependencies using the following instructions:

- [For
  Windows](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites)
- [For
  Linux](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp?tab=readme-ov-file#ubuntu)

## From GitHub (recommended)

Install the latest released version from GitHub using the `{remotes}`
package. This installation method downloads and installs all required
dependencies.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R@*release")
```

To install the latest development version:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R")
```

## From package archive files (Deprecated)

Install manually from pre-built archive files available in the
[releases](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/releases).

#### Install CRAN dependencies

Installing from archive files requires manual installation of CRAN
dependencies first.

``` r
# Install dependencies (e.g. R6) which are on CRAN
install.packages("cli")
install.packages("crayon")
install.packages("data.table")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggtext")
install.packages("glue")
install.packages("jsonlite")
install.packages("lifecycle")
install.packages("logger")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("patchwork")
install.packages("purrr")
install.packages("R6")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("rlang")
install.packages("showtext")
install.packages("stringi")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("xml2")
```

#### Install non-CRAN dependencies

Pre-built packages are available as binary files (*.zip for Windows,
*.tar.gz for Linux) Download the OSPSuite-R binary archive from the
[releases
page](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/releases).
Download and install these additional non-CRAN dependencies:

- [`{rSharp}`](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp/releases/latest)
- [`{ospuite.utils}`](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite.RUtils/releases/latest)
- [`{tlf}`](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/TLF-Library/releases/latest)

In [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/), use the *Install* option in
the *Packages* pane and select *Install from -\> Package Archive File*
to install packages from binary files.

**Note**: CRAN dependencies for `{rSharp}`, `{ospuite.utils}`, and
`{tlf}` were installed in the previous step.

``` r
# Install rSharp from local file 
# Replace pathTo_rSharp.zip with the actual path to the .zip file (or to the .tar.gz file on Linux)
install.packages(pathTo_rSharp.zip, repos = NULL)

# Install ospsuite.utils from local file
# Replace pathTo_ospsuite.utils.zip with the actual path to the .zip file (or to the .tar.gz file on Linux)
install.packages(pathTo_ospsuite.utils.zip, repos = NULL)

# Install tlf from local file
# Replace pathTo_tlf.zip with the actual path to the .zip file (or to the .tar.gz file on Linux)
install.packages(pathTo_tlf.zip, repos = NULL)

# Install ospsuite from local file
# Replace pathToOSPSuite.zip with the actual path to the .zip file (or to the .tar.gz file on Linux)
install.packages(pathTo_OSPSuite.zip, repos = NULL)
```

# Known issues

## Loading `ospsuite` might fail if the system locale is not set to English

- On Windows, set
  `Settings > Language > Administrative language settings > Current language for non-Unicode programs`
  to `English (United States)` and reboot.

- On Linux, set the environment variable `LC_ALL` to `~/.bashrc` before
  starting R:

  `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`

- add the path to the lib subfolder of installed ospsuite package to
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/ospsuite/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

## Saving and loading the workspace in RStudio does not restore objects

The ospsuite package uses the features implemented in PK-Sim and MoBi by
creating `.NET` objects (e.g. a simulation) and using them from R. These
objects cannot be saved as part of the workspace and reloaded on next
start. Upon restoring the workspace, the objects will be `NULL` and
cannot be re-used.

# Development

## Embedded binaries

The `{ospsuite}` package requires shared libraries to access PK-Sim
functionality. To obtain the latest libraries (**.dll** on Windows or
**.so** on Linux), run the `update_core_files.R` script included with
this package.

Because `{ospsuite}` contains binary files, it is classified as a binary
package and cannot be submitted to CRAN.

## macOS ARM64 Development Setup

On macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon), the package automatically fixes a SQLite
compatibility issue on first load by converting certain VIEWs to TABLEs
in `PKSimDB.sqlite`. This modification is applied locally and should not
be committed to git.

To prevent git from tracking these local database changes, run this once
after cloning the repository:

``` sh
git update-index --skip-worktree inst/lib/PKSimDB.sqlite
```

The fix is automatically re-applied when the database file’s
modification date is newer than the marker file (indicating a database
update from upstream).

To temporarily check the database status:

``` sh
git update-index --no-skip-worktree inst/lib/PKSimDB.sqlite
git status inst/lib/PKSimDB.sqlite
git update-index --skip-worktree inst/lib/PKSimDB.sqlite
```

**Note:** The `RSQLite` package is required on macOS ARM64 to apply this
fix. Install it with `install.packages("RSQLite")` if you encounter
issues during package load.

## Versioning

The package follows the versioning process described in the [OSP R
collaboration
guide](https://dev.open-systems-pharmacology.org/r-development-resources/collaboration_guide#releasing-versions).

For development versions, [this GitHub
action](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/blob/main/.github/workflows/main-workflow.yaml#L11-L17)
automatically increments the `.9000` version suffix when pull requests
are merged.
