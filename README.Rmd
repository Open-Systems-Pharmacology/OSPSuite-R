# Installation

The **ospsuite** package is compatible with R version 4.x.x and can be used on 
[Windows](#on-windows) and [Linux](#on-linux) operating systems.

`ospsuite` is not available on CRAN and also depends on packages from the OSP ecosystem
that are not available on CRAN. Please follow the instructions below to install
the packages and all required dependencies.


## On Windows

### Pre-requisites

The package requires additional software installations:


- Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 available [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) 
- .NET 8 runtime available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime).

**NB**: These pre-requisites are already installed if the OSP Suite was installed before.

### From GitHub (recommended)

The latest released version of the package can be installed from GitHub
using the `{pak}` package. The code below will download and install
all the required dependencies.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R@*release")
```

Get the latest development version with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R")
```

### From package archive files

It is also possible to install manually from archive pre-built archive files provided
with the [release](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/releases).

#### Install CRAN dependencies

When installing from such files, the CRAN dependencies need to be installed 
manually first.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
# This code chunck gathers all Depends and Imports dependencies of **installed**
# versions of the packages and generate a string that is printed in the README.md
# file.

library(pacman)

non_cran_deps <- c("rSharp", "ospsuite.utils", "tlf", "ospsuite")
deps <- c()

for (non_cran_dep in non_cran_deps) {
  package_deps <- p_depends(non_cran_dep, local = T, character.only = T)
  deps <- sort(unique(c(deps, package_deps$Depends, package_deps$Imports)))
}

deps <- deps[!deps %in% c("methods", non_cran_deps)]

dep_install <- paste('install.packages("', deps, '")', sep = "", collapse = "\n")



cat("```r \n")
cat("# Install dependencies (e.g. R6) which are on CRAN\n")
cat(dep_install)
cat("\n``` \n")
```

#### Install non-CRAN dependencies

Each of the pre-built released packages are available as a a binary `*.zip`.
OSPSuite-R binary archive can be downloaded from
[here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/releases). The
other non-CRAN dependencies needed for OSPSuite-R also have to be downloaded and
manually installed:

  - [`rSharp`](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp/releases/latest)
  - [`ospsuite.utils`](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite.RUtils/releases/latest)
  - [`tlf`](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/TLF-Library/releases/latest)

If you use [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/), you can use the *Install*
option in the *Packages* pane and select the option *Install from -\> Package
Archive File* to install a package from binary `*.zip` files.

**NB**: The CRAN dependencies of rSharp, ospuite.utils and tlf were already
installed during the previous step.


```r
# Install `{rSharp}` from local file 
# (`pathTo_rSharp.zip` here should be replaced with the actual path to the `.zip` file)
install.packages(pathTo_rSharp.zip, repos = NULL)

# Install `{ospsuite.utils}` from local file 
# (`pathTo_ospsuite.utils.zip` here should be replaced with the actual path to the `.zip` file)
install.packages(pathTo_ospsuite.utils.zip, repos = NULL)

# Install `{tlf}` from local file 
# (`pathTo_tlf.zip` here should be replaced with the actual path to the `.zip` file)
install.packages(pathTo_tlf.zip, repos = NULL)

# Install `{ospsuite}` from local file
# (`pathToOSPSuite.zip` here should be replaced with the actual path to the `.zip` file)
install.packages(pathToOSPSuite.zip, repos = NULL)
```

## On Linux

The **ospsuite** package has been tested under Linux distribution
**Ubuntu 22**. Installation
under Linux requires several prerequisites, the detailed instructions
can be found in the Wiki:

- [Setup OSPSuite-R on
  CentOS](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/wiki/Setup-ospsuite-R-on-CentOS7)
- [Setup OSPSuite-R on
  Ubuntu](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/wiki/Setup-ospsuite-R-on-Ubuntu)

For other Linux distributions Docker containers can be used (Dockerfiles
based on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18 are available under
<https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/releases>)

## Build from source

You can clone the GIT repository and build the package from source.

### How to update dependencies from nuget?

-   `git submodule update --init --recursive` to install all submodules
-   Make sure you have [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/de/downloads/)
    install and that it is available in your path
-   Run `rake postclean` or simply double click on `postclean.bat`. This
    will update all nuget packages and copy the dependencies in the
    package `inst/lib` folder.


# Known issues

## Loading `ospsuite` might fail if your systems locale is not set to English

-- On Windows, set
`Settings > Language > Administrative language settings > Current language for non-Unicode programs`
to `English (United States)` and reboot. -- On Linux, set the
environment variable `LC_ALL` before starting R:

```         
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

## Saving and loading the workspace in RStudio does not restore objects

The ospsuite package uses the features implemented in PK-Sim and MoBi by
creating `.NET` objects (e.g.Â a simulation) and using them from R. These
objects cannot be saved as part of the workspace and reloaded on next
start. Upon restoring the workspace, the objects will be `NULL` and cannot be
re-used.
