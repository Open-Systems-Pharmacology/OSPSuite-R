# ospsuite 11.1.197

## New features

* Adds new visualization functions:

    - `plotObservedVsSimulated()` for observed versus simulated data scatter plot.
    - `plotResidualsVsTime()` for time versus residuals data scatter plot.
    - `plotResidualsVsSimulated()` for simulated versus residuals data scatter plot.

* Adds new helper functions to work with `DataCombined` objects:

    - `convertUnits()` to convert datasets in `DataCombined` to common units.
    - `calculateResiduals()` to calculate residuals for datasets in `DataCombined`.

## Major Changes

* The class `SimulationBatch` gets a new property `id`.

* The output of `runSimulationBatches()` is now a named list with names being 
  the ids of `SimulationBatch`.
  
* `calculateResiduals()` now uses `log(base = 10)` for calculation of residuals 
in logarithmic scale instead if `log(base = exp(1))`
* `calculateResiduals()` does also return residuals for entries where simulated 
or observed value is 0 in logarithmic scale. These values were ignored in previous 
versions. If the observed or simulated value is zero or negative, it is replaced 
by an arbitrary small value `getOSPSuiteSetting("LOG_SAFE_EPSILON")` (1e-20 by default).
  
## Minor Changes

* `SimulationBatch$addRunValues()` will throw an error when any start value is `NaN`
* `SimulatioBatch` gets methods `getVariableParameters()` and `getVariableMolecules()`
that return list of parameter resp. molecule paths that are defined variable.
    
# ospsuite 11.0.123

## New features

* Adds new `DataCombined` class that combines observed data (`DataSet`) and
  simulated data (`SimulationResults`) into a single object. Especially
  important is the `$toDataFrame()` method of this object that returns a data
  frame containing combined data from observed and simulated data, which can be
  further used for visualizations or other analysis.

* Adds new visualization functions:

    - `plotIndividualTimeProfile()` and `plotPopulationTimeProfile()` to create 
      time-profile plots.

* Adds a new class `DefaultPlotConfiguration` to provide plot configurations for 
  plotting functions.

* Adds `simulationResultsToDataFrame()` function to convert `SimulationResults`
  objects into a data frame.

* All `*ToDataFrame()` functions also get `*ToTibble()` variants to extract a
  tibble data frame instead of a classical data frame.

## Major Changes

* Following functions are marked for deprecation and will be removed in future
  releases:

    - `pkAnalysesAsDataFrame()` is now `pkAnalysesToDataFrame()`

    - `populationAsDataFrame()` is now `populationToDataFrame()`

## Breaking changes

* Signature for `toUnit` function has changed. `molWeight` is now the fifth,
  while `sourceUnit` is the fourth parameter (#837).

* `DataImporterConfiguration`: fields `timeUnitFromColumn` and
  `measurementUnitFromColumn` are renamed to `isTimeUnitFromColumn` and
  `isMeasurementUnitFromColumn`

* The constructor for `DataImporterConfiguration` does not accept a path to a
  configuration file any more. Use the function
  `loadDataImporterConfiguration()` to create a configuration object from a
  file.

* The constructor for `DataSet` objects requires a `name` argument.

* All `validate*()` helper functions and `"%||%"` infix operators are no longer
  exported. Please have a look at the new utility package, from which these
  functions are now exported:
  <https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/OSPSuite.RUtils/>.

* The `pkAnalysesAsDataFrame()` function changes column data types for
  `QuantityPath`, `Parameter`, and `Unit` from `factor` to `character`
  (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R/issues/673).
