\title{Runs one  simulation (individual or population) and returns a \code{SimulationResults} object containing all results of the simulation.
Alternatively if multiple simulations are provided, they will be run concurrently. This feature is only supported for individual simulation}
\usage{
runSimulations(
  simulations,
  population = NULL,
  agingData = NULL,
  simulationRunOptions = NULL,
  silentMode = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulations}{One \code{Simulation} or list of \code{Simulation}  to simulate.}

\item{population}{Optional instance of a \code{Population} to use for the simulation. This is only used when simulating one simulation
Alternatively, you can also pass the result of \code{createPopulation} directly. In this case, the population will be extracted}

\item{agingData}{Optional instance of \code{AgingData} to use for the simulation. This is only used with a population simulation}

\item{simulationRunOptions}{Optional instance of a \code{SimulationRunOptions} used during the simulation run}

\item{silentMode}{If \code{TRUE}, no warnings are displayed if a simulation fails. Default is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
SimulationResults (one entry per Individual) for a single simulation or
a list of \code{SimulationResults} objects with names being the IDs of the simulations. If a simulation fails, the result for this simulation is \code{NULL}
}
\description{
Runs one  simulation (individual or population) and returns a \code{SimulationResults} object containing all results of the simulation.
Alternatively if multiple simulations are provided, they will be run concurrently. This feature is only supported for individual simulation

# Running an individual simulation
# Results is an instance of `SimulationResults`

# Creating custom simulation run options

# Running a population simulation

# Running multiple simulations in parallel

# Results is an array of `SimulationResults`
